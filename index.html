                                The Soap Lake Lava®Lamp is a technically advanced structure incorporating fabric tension, high efficiency solar cell, and advanced laser projection technology to mimic the random, fluid, bubble-like "lava" forms universally associated with the classic Lava®Lamp manufactured by Lava®Lite LLC.<br>

                            The laser projectors have the capability of projecting a wide variety of images via rear screen projection onto the enclosing weatherproof fabric scrim fabricated from Tenara® architectural fabric by SEFAR. This remarkable fabric is woven with durable fibers developed by W. L. Gore (manufactures of Gore-Tex). <br>

                            The principal function of the Lava®Lamp will be one hour "performances" beginning at dusk every evening and cycling through a complete event. The event would begin with a slow, rolling effect of the lava solids as they appear to slowly heat, shift, and position before transforming into the world famous shape mutations, gently rising and falling for several minutes then eventually subsiding and returning to rest at the bottom of the lamp until the next showing. Through the night a soft, warm glow would be visible until daybreak when the sculptural form will stand quietly alone in preparation for the next nightly "event." <br>

                            The Lava®Lamp will also be used for special events and seasonal showings. Customized thematic programs will be developed for holidays and for special interest groups such as the Ice Age Floods Geologic Trail, Coulee Corridor National Scenic Byway, the Audubon Society's Great Washington State Coulee Corridor Birding Trail, Soap Lake Conservancy, Soap Lake Heritage, the Colville Indian tribes, and others. Seasonal shows will be available to enhance local town celebrations and activities such as Winterfest, New Year's, 4th of July, Lava Love Run, Smokiam Days, and others. <br>

                            It is anticipated visitors will be inclined to have a meal, stay overnight, visit other area attractions, and return often to see new showings. The technology is such that no two showings will be the same. </p>

					<div class="dropdown">
						<span class="head3">Why a Lava Lamp?
				</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content">
						<p class="para3">
			Good question...actually there are several reasons. The iconic Lava®Lamp image is as recognizable as Seattle's Space Needle and has already been associated with the City of Soap Lake for almost 10 years. The lamp will be sited on basalt that overlays 14 million year old lava beds. The last historical heyday of Soap Lake occurred back in the early 1960's coincident with the invention and first appearance of the original Lava Lamp. The health benefits of the mineral qualities of Soap Lake is well documented and for nearly a century people have visited the small lake seeking relief for various ailments and skin disorders. Historically, it was a gathering place for native indians who revered its healing qualities and today popular interest in the holistic medicines has brought a renewed focus on these benefits. The "original" version of the Lava Lamp is valued for its meditative qualities and is now used for stress release and holistic treatment for many forms of mental disorders. Google has a signature Lava Lamp called "Google Lamp" found at many employee workstations. That meditative quality will also be exhibited by the Soap Lake Lava®Lamp.

					<div class="dropdown">
						<span class="head3">Who is organizing the construction and installation?
				</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content">
						<p class="para3">
	A team of professional Architects, Engineers, and Contractors.
</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="dropdown">
						<span class="head3">Will it be very bright at night?
				</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content">
						<p class="para3">
No. The laser projectors operate at a very low wattage level and produce remarkably little light bleed. The images will be sharp and crisp but will add very little ambient light to the surrounding area. A primary mandate for the Lamp is no light pollution and the projects advanced laser technology makes this possible.

					<div class="dropdown">
						<span class="head3">When will I be able to go see the Soap Lake Lava Lamp?

						1. Hiking, rock climbing, biking, birding, kayaking, sailing, fishing, hunting, golf.
						2. Live theater, art galleries, indian culture, western history, holistic arts.
						3. Wild flowers, wild life, geology, mineral mud, mineral baths.
						4. The Grand Coulee Dam, Dry Falls Visitors Center and Sun Lakes State Park, 
						The Gorge Amphitheatre, Wild Horse Monument, Moses Lake and Ephrata Historical Museums, Ginkgo Petrified Forest State Park, Omak Stampede, Colville Revervation, and Regional Wineries to name a few.
